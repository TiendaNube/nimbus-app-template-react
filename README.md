# Standalone App Template

This is a template for creating apps for Nuvemshop/Tiendanube ecosystem using Nimbus Design System and the Nuvemshop API. It works as a monorepo as it includes all the code necessary to start and maintain the frontend and backend of the application.

This template includes a starter project for building standalone apps using React for the frontend, with Vite as a framework.

To run the project, navigate to the `app-template-vite` package subdirectory.
```bash
$ cd packages/app-template-vite
```

Then install all dependencies.
```bash
$ yarn
```

Finally, run the `dev` command to start the development server.
```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Happy editing!
