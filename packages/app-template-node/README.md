# StoreProductControl API

This is a powerful tool that enables app authentication and provides functionalities to efficiently manage products within an installed Nuvemshop/Tiendanube store. This API allows developers to securely authenticate their applications and perform operations such as inserting new 5 products randomly, deleting existing products, and retrieving the total count of products in the store. With seamless integration and comprehensive product management capabilities, this API streamlines the process of handling and maintaining product data, empowering developers to build robust and scalable applications for Nuvemshop/Tiendanube-powered e-commerce solutions.
